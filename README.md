## 🀄 Simtracan Translator

**Simtracan Translator** is a translation software that (at its 0.1.3 version) can translate between Mandarin Chinese Simplified, Mandarin Chinese Traditional, Mandarin Chinese Pinyin, Cantonese, Cantonese Pinyin, Chinese Zhuyin and Chinese Unicode Characters.

This software was developed in Python by Daniela Bai (Daniela Barazarte) and it’s main goal is to translate text in multiple derivations of Chinese language without limit of characters, without ads, with great translation and having multiple options in the same translator.

Right now it is able to translate most of the Chinese Characters as it contains a library of more than 18.000 汉字.

### Motivation

Almost two years ago I started to learn Mandarin Chinese and since I am so interested in the language I found some partners to practice with, one of them was a girl from Guangdong who, to play a joke on me, texts messages in Cantonese.

While improving my Chinese, I was also learning Python through a some Youtube tutorial and was willing to putting the knowledge into practice so…as before I couldn't find good translators who could give the translation from Cantonese to Simplified Mandarin to understand my partner's messages, why not build it myself? and that's how Simtracan Translator came to mind.

It was hard at first, considering that I am very new to the programming aspect and not good at Cantonese at all, but even with that I decided to build it.

I started the project and made the decision to call it “Simtracan Translator” as it includes Simplified, Traditional and Cantonese Chinese. Now I am very excited to show this project.

## 🚀 Installation

### Pre-requisites

Python 3.x.x

The only aditional Library that his software use is Regex that comes as default in most of the Python versions.

> After version 1.2.0 it uses Tkinter
>

**Explanation** 

*(This is the explanation of version 0.1.3, different versions work similar)*

You’ll need to input the text you want to translate

> The software will automatically check the text that you input with a Regex Function
> 

Select a number that tells in what language is that text that you input

Select other number and select the language you want to receive the translation.

> If you selected an option incorrectly, or if you selected the same language twice, the software will display an error message and let you select an option (you have three tries to select the option correctly)
> 

Receive your translation

### Python GUI mode

- Open the .exe

- Use the translator

**Explanation**

With an interactive interface you’ll need the text you want to translate. You can paste the text on the Text Area, or get it from a file on your computer. 

You can also check the text you input.

> It will count how many characters do your text has, and also tell you whether it is on Pinyin or in Chinese Characters
> 

Then you must select in the option menu what language is that text that you input.

Select in other option menu the language you want to receive the translation

Click on “Translate” and receive your translation

> If you selected an option incorrectly, or if you selected the same language twice, the software will display an error message and let you select an option again
> 

Save your translation by saving it to a file that can be .txt or .html

### Detailed explanation

Even if different versions work slightly different, the way this software works in general is that you’ll input the text you want to translate, then select in what language is that text (lang_A) and then, select in what language you want that text to be translated (lang_B), then it will display the translation for you.

```python
#----------- stage 1
# Input from the user
user_input = "为" 

# Comment about the text user input
OUTPUT: "The text you input: \- Contain Hanzi \- Contains (1) character"

#----------- stage 2
# Selection from the user
from_lang = "1" # tranlation from Simplified Mandarin
to_lang = "2" # translation to Traditional Mandarin

#----------- stage 3
# Final Translation
OUTPUT: "Translation complete: 為"
```

- **Stage 1: Text input**
    
    When you input the text, it is automatically checked by a Regex Formula that will tell whether the text you input has Chinese Characters, Latin Script or Zhuyin, so it can try to guess in what language is the text you input.
    
    - (code)
        
        ```python
        # Example of user input
        user_input = "为"
        
        # Text checker is a checker that will automatically check a text and tell wether it has Chinese Characters, Latin Script or Zhuyin
        def text_checker(user_input):
            hanzi_list = "[\u4e00-\u9fff]+" # Hanzi (Chinese Characters) unicode list
            latin_list = "[\0000-\u007F]+" # Latin Script unicode list
            zhuyin_list = "[\u3100-\u31A0]+" # Zhuyin unicode list
        
            textLength = len(user_input) - 1 # checker of how many letters/character a text have
        
            if (re.search(hanzi_list, user_input)):
                print("The text you input: \- Contain Hanzi \- Contains (", textLength, ") characters")
                return("")
            else:
                pass
            if (re.search(zhuyin_list, user_input)):
                print("The text you input: \- Contain Zhuyin characters \- Contains (", textLength, ") characters")
                return ("")
            else:
                pass
            if (re.search(latin_list, user_input)):
                print("The text you input: \- Contain letters of Latin Script \- Contains (", textLength, ") letters")
                return ("")
            else:
                pass
        
        ```
        
- **Stage 2: Selection of lang_A and lang_B**
    
    When you select in what language is the text you input (lang_A) it will output/show the option you selected. Same case when you select in what language is the text you input (lang_B) it will output/show the option you selected
    
    A function will save your selection of lang_A and your selection of lang_B, this way will know what dictionary to use (langA_to_langB)
    
    - (code)
        
        ```python
        # Input from the user
        user_input = "为"
        
        # Selection from the user
        from_lang = "1" # in what language is the text user input
        to_lang = "2" # in what language user will receive the translation
        
        # Option Selection for languages
           if from_lang == '1' and to_lang == '2': # 1 is Simplified Mandarin, 2 is Traditional Mandarin
               translate_text = (get_translation(user_input, simplified2traditional_dictionary)) # it saves the text the user input and selects the dictionary for languages
               print("Translation done:")
               return(translate_text) # returns the text
        ```
        
- **Stage 3: Translation between lang_A and lang_B**
    
    Then the will pick the text you input and every single character/word will be replaced from the lang_A to lang_B by the .replace() method.
    
    - (code)
        
        ```python
        # Input from the user
        user_input = "为"
        
        # Example of dictionary
        simplified2traditional_dictionary = {'为':'為'}
        
        # Get translation
        def get_translation(user_input, dictionary): # will take the text from the user and also the dictionary that will be used for the translation
            for word, replace in dictionary.items(): # will replace every single character of the user input to one that it can finds in the dictionary
                text = text.replace(word, replace)
            return(text)
        ```
        
    
    The result of the .replace() will be output/show for you

I input all of the wordlist in a Excel File, but as I needed to transform it from Excel File to a Dictionary in Python, I used the [PANDAS](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library in order to do it
